A phishing scam struck my university and I got curious. Did some poking around in dev tools and found the unprocess frontend source. Rare (to my knowledge) to see a library as new as React being used for nefarious purposes so I've decided to share.

Just so everything is clear, this is not me condoning these kinds of activities.
